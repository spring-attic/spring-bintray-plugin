/**
 * Publishing basically means that other users can see and download the files you have uploaded.
 * Only uploaded files (not repos, packages, versions or user profiles) can ever have the status of unpublished.
 * This gives the uploading user time to change his or her mind about the upload or to verify or test it.
 * After 7 days, unpublished files are deleted from Bintray. Note that since unpublished is the default status
 * of an uploaded file, every file manually uploaded must be separately published. Unpublished files are only
 * visible and accessible on Bintray to the user who uploaded them; once these files are uploaded the right and
 * ability to publish them belongs to this user.
 *
 * Publishing has the secondary effect of getting files into JCenter if the package has been pre-approved for
 * JCenter syncing.
